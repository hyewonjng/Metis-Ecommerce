       "373720    A friend gave me my original stainless Whisky. I just loved his look and then I started using it and it is great, just right for those small jobs of beating an egg or mixing flour/milk for gravy. The whisk did fall out of the base after a while (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but I loved him so much I glued it back together and he has been working ever since. Some days I look at him on my prep shelf and think \"I know how you feel buddy\". Anyway, it works well and brightens my day. I am ordering the silicone orange one now too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "204047    I have to admit I am thoroughly dissappointed by this book and cannot understand the positive reviews it received from several of the other readers, except that they may be academics. If you are somebody who is only interested in the theory and philosophical background of corporate partnerships, this might be the book you are looking for, but if you are, like myself, a practical doer, who is looking for hands-on insight and knowledge on this topic, you will be deeply dissappointed. Also several of the examples of \"showcase\" alliances, such as Iridium, are not only outdated, but in fact, bankrupt. Very annoying to read about these \"great\" alliances, that several months after publishing went belly up. To sum it up, for the practical business professionals among you, I suggest you keep on researching on other books in this genre. Unfortunately, since I didn't read yet any other books on this topic, I cannot offer an alternative book advice.\n",

       "230415    I really enjoyed this film. The opening sequence left alot to be desired in regard to cinematography. Small suggestion, but I think you should have chosen a different location for the opening. Too much white! It was hard to watch even on this small screen.But, that said, I think these guys did a really good job creating a fluffy little comedy with heart. I was pleasantly surprised by the special FX of the coin going into the meter. That almost makes up for the shaky beginning!This team had alot on their hands, considering the huge cast, multiple locations and set-ups. Could have done with less of the song (it's okay, but if felt like a cop-out regarding audio and storyline).Though it's not the best in the competition, these filmmakers might have a long career.                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
